# Configure `kubectl` for Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes

Use this GitHub Action to install and configure `kubectl` to connect to
the specified [Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes][OKE] (OKE) cluster.

## Prerequisites

The target OKE cluster must have a **public Kubernetes API Endpoint** in
order for the GitHub Action to connection to the cluster.

The following [OCI CLI environment variables][1] must be defined for at least
the `configure-kubectl-oke` task:

* `OCI_CLI_USER`
* `OCI_CLI_TENANCY`
* `OCI_CLI_FINGERPRINT`
* `OCI_CLI_KEY_CONTENT`
* `OCI_CLI_REGION`

We recommend using GitHub Secrets to store these values. [Defining your environment variables][2]
at the job or workflow level would allow multiple tasks/jobs to reduce
duplication.

## Inputs

* `cluster`: (Required) The OCID of the OKE cluster to configure

## Sample workflow steps

```yaml
jobs:
  install-kubectl:
    runs-on: ubuntu
    name: Install Kubectl for OKE
    env:
      OCI_CLI_USER: ${{ secrets.OCI_CLI_USER }}
      OCI_CLI_TENANCY: ${{ secrets.OCI_CLI_TENANCY }}
      OCI_CLI_FINGERPRINT: ${{ secrets.OCI_CLI_FINGERPRINT }}
      OCI_CLI_KEY_CONTENT: ${{ secrets.OCI_CLI_KEY_CONTENT }}
      OCI_CLI_REGION: ${{ secrets.OCI_CLI_REGION }}

    steps:
      - name: Configure Kubectl
        uses: oracle-actions/configure-kubectl-oke@v1
        id: test-configure-kubectl-oke-action
        with:
          cluster: ${{ secrets.OKE_CLUSTER }}

      - name: Run Kubectl
        run: kubectl get nodes -A
```

## Security recommendations

The **[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Security Guide][OSG]** details our recommended
**[best practices for securing user authentication][BP]** which include:

* creating **a dedicated service user account** specifically for GitHub Actions;
* assigning that service account a **unique** and **complex** password;
* **rotating the API signing key pair** used by the service account every 90 days; and
* using **[GitHub encrypted secrets][GHS]** to store credentials.

> **Tip:** if you [create these secrets in your organization][SO], you can limited
> which repositories have access to these secrets while also avoiding duplicating
> the credentials in multiple repositories.
